  title: Turkestan Series
  description: |
      The Turkestan Series of paintings was created during two expeditions to Central Asia in 1867–1868 and 1869–1870, as well as in Paris during the winter of 1868–1869 and in Munich between 1871 and 1873.

      In the summer of 1867, V. V. Vereshchagin learned that General Konstantin Petrovich Kaufman—newly appointed as the Governor-General of Turkestan and Commander of the Turkestan Military District—was seeking an artist to join his entourage. Through friends, Vereshchagin secured a meeting with the Governor-General and presented his Caucasian sketches. Kaufman was intrigued by the young man and commissioned him into service with the rank of ensign (praporshchik). Notably, Vereshchagin negotiated the right to abstain from wearing a military uniform and received a guarantee that he would not be considered for further promotions.

    - title: The Apotheosis of War, 1872, Oil on canvas
      description: |
        Apotheosis depicts a pile of human skulls set on the barren earth, the aftermath of a battle or siege. A flock of carrion birds are seen to be occupied with picking over the pile; some birds have already landed, while others are flying in or roosting in nearby trees. The ground below them is a sallow, earthy yellow covered with grass, complementing the dirty ivory color of the partially-bleached skulls. The shadow cast by the mound, coupled with the many black orifices created by empty jaws and eye-sockets, adds a sense of depth to the painting, further exacerbating the scale of the deathly pile.

        A range of mountains serves as a dividing line for the painting, separating the vastness of the steppes from the emptiness of the sky, while the city of Samarkand can be seen in the far right of the painting. The city's walls have visibly been breached, a reference to the Siege of Samarkand in the summer of 1868 in which the Russian garrison repulsed a Bukharid attack. On the work's frame, Vereshchagin inscribed that he dedicated the painting "to all great conquerors, past, present and to come".
