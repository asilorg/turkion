title: Timeline of the Turkic peoples
description: Between 500 and 1300 CE, Turkic peoples expanded from Central Asia to forge empires across Eurasia, beginning with the Göktürk Khaganate in 552. Key developments included the westward migration of Oghuz Turks, the Seljuk capture of Baghdad in 1055, and their victory at Manzikert in 1071, which opened Anatolia for permanent Turkic settlement. By 1300, these movements had widely diffused Turkic languages and military traditions, setting the stage for their integration with the incoming Mongol empire.

      The timeline of the Turkic peoples from 500 to 1300 chronicles the ethnogenesis and state-building of Turkic-speaking nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia, from the consolidation preceding the Göktürk Khaganate's founding in 552 CE as the first attested Turkic empire to the expansion of Oghuz-derived states like the Great Seljuk Empire (1040–1157) and the Sultanate of Rum (1080–1308).[1][2] Originating amid the Altai Mountains and Mongolian steppes, these groups harnessed equine mastery and composite bow technology to forge khaganates that spanned from the Pacific to the Black Sea, supplanting earlier nomads like the Rouran and engaging in tributary relations or warfare with Tang China, Sassanid Persia, and the Byzantine Empire.[2][3] Successor entities included the Uyghur Khaganate (744–840), which promoted urbanism and Manichaeism before its collapse under Kyrgyz assaults, and the Khazar Khaganate (c. 650–969), a Volga-Caspian power known for its Jewish ruling elite and role in blocking Arab expansions northward.[1][3] Western migrations of Pechenegs, Cumans, and especially Oghuz Turks from the 9th century onward displaced earlier populations in the Pontic steppes and facilitated the Seljuks' Islamization, capture of Baghdad in 1055, and decisive victory at Manzikert in 1071, initiating the Turkic settlement of Anatolia.[1][3] By 1300, these dynamics had diffused Turkic languages and military traditions across Eurasia, setting the stage for integration with incoming Mongol forces while underscoring the causal role of ecological pressures, superior tactics, and adaptive governance in their enduring influence.[2][4]

      Modu Chanyu uniting Turkic and Mongolian tribes under Xiongnu, the first turkic state. Xiongnu existed before Modu Chanyu. But, Modu Chanyu was the one to unite most of the Turkic tribes and make bigger contributions, compared to his Father. He killed his father in his father's tent with his most loyal archers. His father married a chinese princess and they had a child. This move was a strategic move by the Chinese to take over the empire, in which they succeeded and took over Turkic empires and states in history. This was not the case with Xiongnu though, as Modu realized the situation and ordered his men to execute his father for his "treachery to state". Modu then took over the state and established an army, in which the date of it is accepted as the symbolic establishment date of Turkish Land Forces.

      ## Establishment of the Göktürk Khaganate

      The Göktürk Khaganate, the first centralized Turkic state, emerged in 552 CE through the rebellion of the Ashina clan against their Rouran overlords in the Mongolian steppes. Bumin (Tumen), leader of the Ashina Turks who controlled iron mines in the Altai Mountains, capitalized on Rouran internal divisions and economic leverage from weapon production to assert independence. In coordination with his brother Istämi, Bumin allied with the Western Wei dynasty of China, defeating Rouran forces under Anagui Khan and proclaiming himself Il Qaghan (Sovereign Emperor) that year, thereby unifying disparate Turkic tribes under a dual khaganate structure with eastern and western wings.[5][6]

      This establishment marked a shift from tribal vassalage to imperial hegemony, as the Göktürks rapidly subdued neighboring groups like the Tiele and expanded control over the eastern Eurasian steppes, leveraging cavalry tactics and the tengri sky-god ideology central to Turkic rulership. Chinese chronicles, such as the Zhou Shu, record Bumin's envoys seeking recognition from the Western Wei emperor, who granted titles in exchange for Rouran captives, confirming the khaganate's consolidation by late 552. Bumin's death shortly thereafter—likely from natural causes—led to succession by his son Issik Qaghan (Kara Issik), while Istämi governed the western territories, solidifying the khaganate's bipolar administration that balanced power between siblings to prevent fragmentation.[7]

      Later Orkhon inscriptions from the 8th century affirm this founding narrative, attributing to Bumin and Istämi the division of the world between them—"When the blue sky above and the brown earth below were created, between them a human being was created... My ancestors Bumin Kagan and Istemi Kagan ruled over the people"—emphasizing causal factors like tribal unification and anti-Rouran campaigns as foundational to Göktürk identity and expansion. By 555 CE, the Rouran khaganate had fully collapsed, with remnants submitting to Chinese states or integrating into Göktürk domains, enabling the new khaganate to extract tribute and project power across Central Asia.[5][6]

      ## Göktürk Apogee and Tang Conflicts

      The Eastern Göktürk Khaganate attained its zenith in the early 7th century under Illig Qaghan (r. 620–630), who restored centralized authority following decades of fratricidal strife and fragmentation after the death of Taspar Qaghan in 581.[8] Illig subdued vassal tribes including the Xueyantuo and expanded influence across the Mongolian Plateau, extracting annual tribute of 100,000 bolts of silk from the nascent Tang dynasty while maintaining suzerainty over nomadic confederations from the Altai to the eastern steppes.[9] This period of dominance reflected Göktürk military prowess, with their cavalry forces numbering up to 100,000 warriors, enabling raids deep into Chinese territory and diplomatic leverage that compelled Tang Emperor Gaozu to seek alliance in 617 during the Sui collapse.[8]

      Tensions escalated after the Xuanwu Gate Incident in 626, when Taizong (Li Shimin) ascended amid internal purges; Illig exploited Tang instability by advancing armies to the Weishui River near Chang'an, forcing a humiliating peace treaty that included increased tribute and territorial concessions.[8] However, Göktürk apogee unraveled due to environmental catastrophes—severe snowstorms and droughts from 627–628 decimating herds and sparking famines—compounded by elite jealousies and tribal defections to Tang agents.[9] Taizong capitalized on these fissures, dispatching General Li Jing with 100,000 troops in a multi-pronged winter offensive in 629, employing feigned retreats and rapid cavalry maneuvers to outflank Göktürk positions.[9]

      The decisive clash occurred at Yinshan in early 630, where Tang forces shattered Illig's army at Tieshan, prompting his flight; Li Jing pursued and captured the qaghan near Dingxiang on March 27, 630, along with his son and 15,000 elites, effectively dismantling the khaganate's core structure.[8][9] Tang incorporated surviving Ashina clans as puppets, installing Ashina Jiesheshuai as a nominal qaghan under the Jimi tributary system, while Xueyantuo tribes filled the power vacuum north of the Gobi, setting the stage for further Tang interventions.[8] These conflicts, chronicled in Tang annals like the Jiu Tangshu, underscored Göktürk overextension against a resurgent agrarian empire leveraging superior logistics and intelligence.[9]

      ## Collapse of the First Khaganate

      The unified Göktürk Khaganate began to fracture in the late 6th century due to dynastic conflicts and succession disputes within the Ashina clan, exacerbated by economic strains from prolonged wars and harsh climatic conditions. Following the death of Taspar Khagan in 581, rival claimants including his son Apa Khagan and uncle Tardu Khagan engaged in civil strife, weakening central authority and prompting tribal defections.[6] These internal divisions culminated in the khaganate's effective collapse by 603, splitting into the semi-independent Eastern Turkic Khaganate under Yami lineage rulers and the Western Turkic Khaganate under Tardu lineage rulers, with the former controlling territories east of the Altai Mountains.[8]

      The Eastern Khaganate, initially stabilized under Chuluo Khagan (r. 617–620) and then Illig Khagan (r. 620–630), faced renewed instability from 620 onward, including rebellions by subordinate tribes like the Xueyantuo and severe snowstorms in 627–628 that decimated livestock and provoked mass discontent. Illig's harsh exactions and favoritism toward certain allies alienated key supporters, while Tang Dynasty envoys exploited these fissures by forging alliances with disaffected Turkic leaders such as the Tiele tribes.[10] In 627, Emperor Taizong of Tang authorized preemptive strikes, mobilizing forces under generals Li Jing and Li Shiji to probe northern borders.[8]

      The decisive Tang campaign unfolded in late 629 to spring 630, with Li Jing's army of approximately 100,000, augmented by Turkic auxiliaries, advancing through the Yin Mountains to surprise Illig's encampment at Niehpanbo (near modern Baotou, Inner Mongolia) on March 17, 630. Illig Khagan fled but was captured shortly after, along with his son and key regalia including the sacred wolf standard and heavenly drum, symbols of Göktürk legitimacy; over 100,000 Turkic households surrendered, marking the Eastern Khaganate's subjugation as Tang protectorates.[10] [8] Many Eastern Turks were resettled within Tang borders, contributing to military forces but diluting nomadic cohesion, while remnants fled westward, presaging migrations that influenced later Turkic polities.[6]

      ## Second Göktürk Khaganate

      The Second Göktürk Khaganate was reestablished in 682 CE when Ilteriş Qaghan (r. 682–691), also known as Kutlug, a member of the Ashina clan, led a revolt against Tang dynasty overlords and captured the sacred center of Ötüken in Mongolia, uniting fragmented Turkic tribes including the remnants of the Oğuz, Basmıl, and other groups previously subjugated by Chinese forces.[5][11] This revival followed decades of Tang protectorate control after the first khaganate's collapse, exploiting Chinese internal weaknesses during the Wu Zetian era to restore Ashina authority over the eastern steppes.[12] Ilteriş's campaigns focused on consolidating power eastward from the Yin Mountains, subduing local rivals and reasserting nomadic sovereignty without immediate large-scale western expansion.

      Under Ilteriş's brother and successor, Qapaghan Qaghan (r. 691–716), the khaganate expanded aggressively, incorporating tribes such as the Bayırku, Toquz Oghuz, and Kyrgyz through military coercion and tribute extraction, while raiding Tang borders in 698 and 711 to secure resources and prestige.[5] Qapaghan's death during a 716 campaign against the Bayırku tribe triggered succession struggles, leading to the ascension of his nephew Bilge Qaghan (r. 716–734), supported by his brother Kul Tigin as military commander (shad). Bilge's reign marked the khaganate's peak, with victories over Tang forces in 717–718 that halted Chinese incursions and forced tribute payments by 720, alongside defenses against Kyrgyz and eastern threats; these feats are detailed in the Orkhon inscriptions, runic monuments erected in 732 for Kul Tigin and posthumously for Bilge in 735, emphasizing themes of tribal unity, anti-Chinese independence, and Tengrist legitimacy.[11][13]

      Post-Bilge decline accelerated after Kul Tigin's death in 731 and Bilge's in 734, with unstable rulers like Yollïg Tengri Qaghan and Özmiş Khagan (r. 734–741) facing assassinations and revolts amid factional strife among subordinate tribes.[14] Tengri Qaghan (r. 741–744) was murdered by his own shad in 741, exacerbating chaos that invited external intervention; in 744, a coalition of Uyghurs under Kutlug Bilge Kagan, allied with Karluks and Basmıls, overthrew the Göktürks, capturing Ötüken, executing the last khagan, and establishing Uyghur dominance, thus terminating the Second Khaganate after 62 years.[11][14] This fall stemmed from overreliance on coercive tribal alliances and failure to resolve internal power vacuums, as evidenced by Chinese annals and the Orkhon texts' warnings against disunity.[13]

      ## Rise of the Uyghur Khaganate

      The Uyghur Khaganate was established in 744 CE when the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking nomadic confederation primarily from the Toquz Oghuz tribal alliance, overthrew the weakening Second Göktürk Khaganate through a coordinated rebellion involving the Karluks and Basmyls.[15] This uprising capitalized on Göktürk internal strife and military overextension, with the rebels exploiting the khaganate's fragmented authority in the Mongolian steppes.[15]

      In early 744, the Basmyls seized the Göktürk ceremonial capital of Ötüken and executed the reigning khagan Özmiş (also known as Wu-su-mi-shi), temporarily establishing their own short-lived khaganate.[15] The Uyghurs, led by Qutluγ Bilgä Köl Qaγan (Kutlug Bilge Kul Qaghan) of the Yaghlakar clan, then allied with the Karluks to decisively defeat the Basmyls later that year, securing Ötüken and eliminating remaining Göktürk resistance, including the execution of the last khagan Kulun Beg in 745, whose head was presented to the Tang court as a gesture of alliance.[15] Qutluγ Bilgä, proclaimed as the first khagan, adopted Göktürk administrative models while relocating the political center to the newly fortified city of Ordu-Baliq (Qara Balgasun) along the Orkhon River, marking a shift toward semi-sedentary governance with advanced urban planning and trade integration.[15]

      The nascent khaganate quickly consolidated power by forging a tributary relationship with the Tang dynasty, receiving the honorific title of Huairen Khan from Emperor Xuanzong in recognition of Uyghur military support against steppe threats.[15] This alliance provided economic benefits through silk and horse trade, enabling the Uyghurs to expand influence over eastern Central Asia, subdue subordinate tribes, and establish a stable realm spanning the Selenga and Orkhon valleys, with an estimated population incorporating tens of thousands of nomadic warriors organized in decimal military units. By the late 740s, under Qutluγ Bilgä's successors like his son Bayanchur Qaghan, the khaganate had transitioned from rebellion to imperial structure, inheriting Göktürk prestige while innovating in diplomacy and craftsmanship to sustain dominance until the 9th century.[15]

      ## Uyghur Dominance and Decline

      The Uyghur Khaganate reached the zenith of its influence in the early 9th century, controlling the eastern Eurasian steppes from the Orkhon Valley to the Altai Mountains and exerting economic leverage over the Tang dynasty through horse trade for silk and other goods.[16] This commerce, facilitated by Sogdian intermediaries, enriched the khagans, enabling urban development at the capital Ordu-Baliq (Karabalghasun), which featured palaces, temples, and irrigation systems supporting semi-sedentary agriculture alongside nomadic pastoralism.[16] Culturally, the Uyghurs advanced a distinct identity, officially adopting Manichaeism as state religion by the late 8th century and adapting the Sogdian script into the Old Uyghur alphabet for administrative, literary, and religious texts, including translations of Buddhist and Manichaean works.[16]

      Diplomatic ties with Tang China bolstered Uyghur power; envoys from the early 9th century often included Manichaean clerics who doubled as traders, securing favorable terms amid Tang internal strife following the An Lushan Rebellion.[16] However, by the 820s, signs of strain emerged, including succession disputes and overreliance on tribute extraction, which fueled discontent among tribal elites and Sogdian financiers integral to the economy.[17] Natural disasters, such as floods and famines in the 830s, exacerbated these tensions, weakening military cohesion and prompting internal revolts.[18]

      The khaganate's collapse accelerated in 840 when internal rivalries culminated in betrayal: a disaffected Uyghur minister, Kulug Bagha, allied with the Yenisei Kyrgyz, inviting their invasion from the north with promises of support.[18] The Kyrgyz, numbering around 80,000–100,000 warriors and backed tacitly by Tang forces seeking to eliminate a troublesome ally, routed Uyghur armies and sacked Ordu-Baliq, killing the khagan (likely Qasar or his successor) and massacring much of the elite.[17][18] This cataclysmic event, compounded by ongoing Kyrgyz-Tang campaigns through 848, dismantled the khaganate's core structure, scattering survivors: some integrated into Kyrgyz tribes, others fled west to establish the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom in Gansu by the 840s, while remnants formed the Qocho Kingdom in the Turfan Depression, preserving Uyghur cultural continuity amid fragmentation.[17]

      ## Western Expansions: Karluks and Oghuz

      In the wake of the Uyghur Khaganate's collapse in 840 CE to Kyrgyz invasions, the Karluks under Bilge Kül Qadir Khan, ruler from Isfijab (modern Saryjuz), declared independence and consolidated power westward across the Semirechye (Zhetysu) and into Ferghana, absorbing fragmented Uyghur territories and tribal allies like the Chigils and Yagmas.[19] This surge displaced weaker groups and positioned Karluk confederations to raid Transoxianan oases, fostering early tensions with the rising Samanid dynasty, whose 839 CE incursion captured Sayram but failed to halt Karluk resurgence.[19] By the late 9th century, western Karluk branches had integrated Sogdian trade networks, enhancing their military capacity through captured artisans and levies numbering in the tens of thousands, as inferred from Arab chroniclers' accounts of steppe incursions.

      Concurrently, Oghuz tribes of the nascent Yabgu State pursued aggressive western thrusts from the Aral Sea fringes, allying with Karluks and Kimaks in the early 9th century to rout Pecheneg and Kangar confederations along the Syr Darya, securing dominance over its middle and lower reaches by circa 830 CE. These campaigns, driven by resource competition and Kyrgyz pressures eastward, displaced upward of 200,000 Pechenegs northwest toward the Ural River and Pontic steppes, enabling Oghuz encampments to span from the Caspian gates to the Amu Darya fringes.[20] Oghuz forces, organized in decimal tribal units under yabgus, exploited the vacuum to extract tribute from urban centers like Jend, laying groundwork for sustained pastoral dominance in the Dasht-i Qipchaq precursor zones.

      ## Karakhanid Khanate and Early Islamization

      The Karakhanid Khanate originated from the Karluk Turkic tribal confederation in the region of Semirechye (modern-day southeastern Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan), coalescing in the mid-9th century after the Karluks contributed to the downfall of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840 CE.[21] By the early 10th century, the confederation had formalized under dual leadership structures typical of Turkic polities, with an eastern khagan in Balasagun and a western ilig in Kashgar, reflecting a division between nomadic and semi-sedentary elements.[22] The early rulers, such as Bilge Kül Qadir Khan (r. circa 920–940), maintained traditional Turkic shamanistic practices while engaging in alliances and conflicts with neighboring powers like the Samanids in Transoxiana. This period laid the groundwork for the khanate's expansion, with Karluk horsemen leveraging their military prowess in raids and as mercenaries for Muslim states, facilitating initial cultural exchanges.[23]

      A turning point in the khanate's history occurred with the conversion of Satuq Bughra Khan (r. 920–955), who adopted Islam around 934 CE under the influence of a Sufi missionary named Abu al-Layth al-Samarqandi and exposure to Muslim traders along the Silk Road.[24] This marked the first large-scale Islamization of a Turkic nomadic ruling elite, distinguishing the Karakhanids from earlier partial conversions among urbanized groups like the Volga Bulgars.[25] Satuq's baptism prompted the gradual conversion of his clan and followers, blending Islamic tenets with Turkic customs such as retaining khagan titles and yurt-based governance, rather than immediate wholesale adoption of sedentary Persian-Islamic models. By the 950s, under his successors like Musa Bughra Khan, Islam had become the state religion, with rulers taking Muslim names while promoting jihad against non-Muslim neighbors, which accelerated the faith's spread among Karluk tribes through military incentives and intermarriage.[22]

      The early Islamization process was pragmatic and uneven, driven by economic ties to Muslim commerce networks and strategic alliances, rather than purely ideological fervor; for instance, Karakhanid forces served in Samanid armies against infidels, gaining prestige and captives who reinforced Islamic practices.[26] This era saw the emergence of Turkic-Islamic hybrid institutions, such as the first madrasas in Central Asia by the late 10th century, fostering literacy in Arabic and Persian among elites while preserving Orkhon Turkic script for administrative use.[27] By 999 CE, under Nasr ibn Ali, the khanate's conquest of Bukhara from the Samanids solidified its role as a vector for Islam's transmission to eastern Turkic groups, with an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Karluks and allied tribes undergoing nominal conversion within decades, though full cultural assimilation lagged until the 11th century.[21]

      ## Ghaznavid Empire and Oghuz Movements

      The Ghaznavid dynasty, originating from Turkic mamluks of likely Karluk stock, was established in 977 CE by Sebük Tigin, a former slave who gained control of Ghazna after succeeding his father-in-law Alp-Tigin, a Samanid general.[28] Sebük Tigin expanded Ghaznavid influence through campaigns against local Hindu Shahi rulers in the Hindu Kush and consolidated power in eastern Khorasan, marking an early instance of Turkic military elites asserting autonomy from Persianate overlords like the Samanids.[29] By his death in 997 CE, the Ghaznavids had secured a base in modern-day Afghanistan, leveraging Turkic cavalry tactics to raid and govern diverse populations.[23]

      Under Sebük Tigin's son, Mahmud (r. 998–1030 CE), the empire reached its zenith through aggressive expansions westward into Khorasan and Iran, defeating the Buyids at Rey in 1029 CE, and eastward via 17 documented raids into northern India between 1000 and 1027 CE.[30] These Indian campaigns targeted wealthy temples, such as the sack of Somnath in 1025 CE, yielding vast plunder estimated in contemporary accounts at millions of dirhams, which funded Ghaznavid patronage of Persian literature and architecture while spreading Sunni Islam among Turkic troops.[31] Mahmud's forces, predominantly Turkic ghulams (slave soldiers), subdued the Hindu Shahis by 1010 CE, annexing Punjab and establishing frontier forts, though the empire's overextension sowed seeds for later Seljuk incursions.[32]

      Concurrently, Oghuz Turkic tribes underwent significant westward migrations in the 10th century, driven by conflicts with Karluks, climatic pressures, and resource scarcity in the Jeti-su region, displacing Pechenegs toward the Black Sea steppes.[33] By the mid-10th century, Oghuz groups had coalesced around the lower Syr Darya, forming the Oghuz Yabgu state under leaders like the yabgu Seljuk, with populations exceeding 300,000 nomads practicing seasonal transhumance between northern pastures and riverine winter camps.[20] These movements facilitated Oghuz infiltration into Transoxiana, where they served as mercenaries for Samanids and clashed with Ghaznavids over border territories, presaging the 11th-century Seljuk westward push into Persia.[34] The Oghuz retained Tengrist elements amid partial Islamization, their tribal confederation emphasizing 24 Oghuz bey clans as per the Dede Korkut traditions, which structured their military and social organization during this migratory phase.[35]

      ## Seljuk Conquests and Empire Building

      The Seljuk Turks, originating from Oghuz tribal confederations in Central Asia, initiated their major conquests under Tughril Beg and his brother Chaghri Beg after migrating westward into Khorasan amid pressures from the Karakhanids and Ghaznavids. The pivotal Battle of Dandanqan on May 23, 1040, saw approximately 16,000 Seljuk horsemen decisively defeat a Ghaznavid army of around 50,000 under Sultan Mas'ud I, exploiting the enemy's supply shortages and low morale through mobile archery tactics and feigned retreats.[36] This victory expelled the Ghaznavids from Khorasan, enabling Tughril to capture Nishapur in 1040 and establish it as a base, marking the transition from tribal raiding to systematic territorial control.[36]

      By 1044, Tughril had consolidated eastern Persia, seizing cities like Merv, Herat, and Rayy, while neutralizing local Buyid emirs through alliances and force, thereby integrating Persian administrative traditions into Seljuk governance.[37] In 1055, Tughril's army of roughly 10,000-20,000 entered Baghdad unopposed, deposing the Buyid regents who had dominated the Abbasid caliph since 945 and securing caliphal investiture as sultan, which legitimized Seljuk rule over Sunni Muslim territories and positioned them as defenders against Shiite Buyid and Fatimid influences.[37] This conquest extended Seljuk influence into Iraq, with Tughril granting iqta land assignments to tribal warriors to sustain loyalty and revenue, laying the foundation for a decentralized yet sultanate-centered empire.

      Alp Arslan, succeeding Tughril in 1063, accelerated westward expansion, subduing Armenia and Georgia by 1064 and raiding Byzantine Syria, before the Battle of Manzikert on August 26, 1071, where his 20,000-25,000 mobile cavalry overwhelmed Emperor Romanus IV's larger but rigid force of up to 100,000 through encirclement and the capture of the emperor himself.[38] This rout fragmented Byzantine defenses in Anatolia, inviting Oghuz tribes to settle and raid unchecked, while Alp Arslan secured Syria and Palestine, extracting tribute from Fatimid Egypt. Under Malik Shah I (r. 1072-1092), the empire peaked with campaigns reaching Yemen and the Caucasus; a 1088 expedition of 50,000 under emir Porsuk reinforced Anatolian gains, and diplomatic marriages with local dynasties stabilized frontiers.[39]

      Empire building emphasized institutionalization, with Persian vizier Nizam al-Mulk (d. 1092) reforming administration from 1063 by centralizing tax collection via the diwan, assigning military iqtas to prevent nomadic unrest, and founding Nizamiyya madrasas in Baghdad, Nishapur, and Isfahan to propagate Sunni orthodoxy and train bureaucrats.[40] These measures, detailed in Nizam's Siyasatnama, balanced Turkic military prowess with Persian fiscal expertise, enabling governance over diverse populations from Transoxiana to the Mediterranean, though underlying tribal rivalries foreshadowed later fragmentation.[40]

      ## Pecheneg and Cuman Invasions of Europe

      The Pechenegs, a confederation of Turkic nomadic tribes originating from the eastern steppes, began migrating westward in the 9th century, driven by conflicts with Oghuz groups and later intensified pressure from the Kipchaks (Cumans). By the early 10th century, they had established dominance north of the Black Sea and Danube, periodically raiding Byzantine territories in the Balkans. A major displacement occurred around 1030–1040 when Cuman incursions from the east forced large Pecheneg groups across the Danube into Bulgarian and Byzantine lands, initiating sustained invasions that destabilized the region's frontiers.[41][42]

      In 1046–1047, under chieftain Tirakh, Pechenegs launched a massive winter crossing of the frozen Danube, invading Thrace and northern Bulgaria, where they plundered settlements and clashed with imperial forces, marking one of the earliest large-scale breaches of Byzantine Balkan defenses. Subsequent raids in the 1050s–1060s, including alliances with Uzes (another Turkic group) in 1064, saw Pechenegs and allies penetrate deep into the empire, sacking cities like Philippopolis and contributing to internal Byzantine instability amid succession crises. By 1078, Pecheneg bands supported rebel general Nikephoros Botaneiates' march on Constantinople, further eroding imperial control over the Balkans.[43][44]

      The culminating Pecheneg offensive unfolded in 1087–1091, when tens of thousands, fleeing Cuman pursuit, flooded south across the Danube under leaders like Togortak and Maniamos, ravaging Wallachia, Bulgaria, and Thrace; they besieged Philippopolis and advanced toward Constantinople, prompting Emperor Alexios I Komnenos to recruit Norman and Cuman auxiliaries. The decisive Battle of Mount Levounion on April 29, 1091, resulted in a catastrophic Pecheneg defeat, with heavy casualties from imperial cataphracts and allied archers; survivors were either incorporated as foederati or sold into slavery, effectively ending Pecheneg military power in Europe. These invasions strained Byzantine resources, accelerated the militarization of the theme system, and facilitated Seljuk gains in Anatolia by diverting imperial attention westward.[45]

      The Cumans (Kipchaks), another western Turkic nomadic federation, advanced into the Pontic steppe in the mid-11th century, supplanting the Pechenegs and initiating raids across Eastern Europe as far as the Carpathians and Kievan Rus'. Their mobility and composite bows enabled hit-and-run tactics, with early incursions into Rus' principalities recorded from 1054–1055, when they defeated Prince Vseslav of Polotsk near the Alta River, exploiting inter-princely feuds for tribute and slaves. By 1068, Cuman forces under khans like Boniak invaded Hungary, devastating the eastern plains during King Solomon's civil war, burning settlements and compelling Hungarian consolidation under Géza I.[46][47]

      Throughout the 1070s–1090s, Cumans conducted over a dozen major raids into Kievan Rus', allying variably with princes like Oleg Sviatoslavich against rivals, as in the 1078–1096 campaigns that sacked Chernigov and Pereiaslav; these incursions fragmented Rus' unity and prompted defensive coalitions, such as the 1103 Dolobsk victory under Vladimir Monomakh. In the Balkans, Cumans exploited Pecheneg collapse, raiding Bulgaria in 1094–1096 alongside Byzantine campaigns and briefly allying with Alexios I against Pechenegs before turning to independent plundering. 12th-century activities included support for Hungarian kings against Byzantium, as in the 1120s–1140s, and intermittent thrusts into Serbia and Wallachia, though declining after Rus' counteroffensives like the 1111 Salnita River battle. Cuman pressures ultimately facilitated Mongol dominance post-1220s, with remnants fleeing to Hungary and Bulgaria, where they integrated as cavalry elites.[42][44]

      ## Seljuk Fragmentation and Sultanates

      The death of Sultan Malik Shah I in November 1092, amid the assassination of his vizier Nizam al-Mulk earlier that year, precipitated a succession crisis that fragmented the Seljuk Empire into rival factions led by Malik Shah's sons and relatives.[48] Barkiyaruq, proclaimed sultan in 1094 at age twelve, struggled against uncles like Tutush I of Syria and brothers including Muhammad Tapar, resulting in a decade of intermittent civil wars that eroded central authority.[48] Muhammad I Tapar eventually prevailed, ruling as sultan from 1105 to 1118 and attempting to restore unity, but his death sparked further disputes, notably between his son Mahmud II and brother Ahmad Sanjar, who controlled the eastern provinces from 1097.[49]

      Ahmad Sanjar's reign as de facto sovereign sultan from 1118 to 1157 saw initial stability in Khorasan and Transoxiana, but external defeats accelerated decline. His army's loss to the Qara Khitai at the Battle of Qatwan on September 9, 1141, compelled tribute payments and undermined prestige.[49] Internal pressures culminated in the 1153 Oghuz revolt, where nomadic Ghuzz tribes defeated and captured Sanjar near Merv, plundering cities like Merv and Nishapur while holding him prisoner until 1156.[50] Sanjar's death in 1157 left the eastern Seljuks without effective leadership, fostering the rise of atabegs and local powers such as the Khwarazmshahs.[49]

      In Anatolia, the Sultanate of Rum, established by Suleiman ibn Qutalmish around 1077, achieved greater autonomy post-1092, transitioning from vassalage to an independent polity centered at Konya after Crusader pressures displaced it from Nicaea in 1097.[51] Under Masud I (r. 1116–1156), Rum consolidated against Danishmend and Byzantine rivals, while Kilij Arslan II (r. 1156–1192) expanded aggressively, culminating in the victory over Emperor Manuel I Komnenos at the Battle of Myriokephalon on September 17, 1176, which halted Byzantine reconquest efforts in Anatolia.[51] This battle solidified Rum's dominance over central and eastern Anatolia, fostering Turkic settlement and Persianate administration.

      Western branches fragmented into atabeg principalities, where Seljuk-appointed military governors assumed hereditary rule. In Mosul and Aleppo, the Zengid dynasty under Imad al-Din Zengi (d. 1146) captured Edessa from Crusaders on December 24, 1144, establishing a semi-independent state that checked Latin advances until Nur al-Din Zengi's expansions in Syria.[51] Similarly, Artuqid atabegs controlled Diyarbakir from 1102, and in Fars and Kirman, Seljuk lines persisted until the Kirman branch fell to the Ghuzz in 1186. Nominally, the Great Seljuk title continued under Mahmud II (1118–1131) and successors like Muhammad II (1159–1176) and Tughril III (1176–1194), but real power devolved to regional sultans and emirs, setting the stage for Mongol incursions.[49]

      ## Turkic Settlement in Anatolia

      The 12th century marked a phase of consolidation for Turkic settlement in Anatolia under the Sultanate of Rum, where nomadic Turkmen tribes, initially drawn by opportunities for plunder and pasture after the 1071 Battle of Manzikert, began establishing more enduring footholds amid stabilizing Seljuk governance. Turkmen groups settled along the Byzantine frontiers, exploiting available grazing lands without centralized state-directed policies, leading to gradual demographic shifts through ongoing immigration and local intermarriages.[51]

      Sultan Masʿud I (r. 1116–1156) played a pivotal role in reviving Seljuk authority following the setbacks of the First Crusade, which had briefly disrupted western expansions by capturing Nicaea in 1097. Masʿud repelled incursions from the Second Crusade, including victories over German and French forces in 1147 near Dorylaeum and Mount Cadmus, thereby securing central Anatolian territories like Iconium (modern Konya) as bases for further tribal influxes and defensive fortifications. These military successes enabled the allocation of iqtaʾ lands to Turkic warriors, encouraging semi-sedentary lifestyles among pastoralists in river valleys and plateaus.[51][52]

      Under Kilij Arslan II (r. 1156–1192), the sultanate expanded aggressively, absorbing rival principalities such as the Danishmends and countering Byzantine offensives. The Battle of Myriokephalon on September 17, 1176, saw Rum Seljuk forces ambush and decisively defeat Emperor Manuel I Komnenos's army in the mountains west of Iconium, shattering Byzantine ambitions to reclaim Anatolia and opening western regions to intensified Turkmen settlement. This victory, leveraging light cavalry tactics suited to the terrain, solidified Seljuk dominance over the peninsula's interior, fostering urban development in Konya and the proliferation of Turkic cultural institutions like madrasas.[51][53]

      By the late 12th century, Anatolia's landscape had transformed, with Turkic pastoralism supplanting Byzantine agrarian patterns in many areas, though full demographic Turkification remained a protracted process extending beyond this period. Surviving monuments and artifacts from mid-century onward attest to the growing permanence of Turkish-Muslim presence, underscoring the role of military security in enabling familial migrations and cultural assimilation.[53][51]

      ## Mongol Conquests of Turkic States

      The Mongol conquests in the 13th century profoundly disrupted major Turkic polities, including the Khwarezmian Empire, Kipchak confederations, and the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, leading to their subjugation or incorporation into the Mongol Empire. These campaigns, initiated under Genghis Khan and continued by his successors, exploited internal divisions and superior Mongol military tactics, resulting in widespread devastation and the integration of surviving Turkic elites into Mongol administrative structures.[54]

      The invasion of the Khwarezmian Empire, a Turkic-ruled state spanning Central Asia and Persia, commenced in 1218 after the governor of Otrar executed Mongol merchants and envoys sent by Genghis Khan.[54] By 1220, Mongol forces under generals Jebe and Subutai had captured key cities including Samarkand and Bukhara, while Shah Muhammad II fled westward and died in exile; his son Jalal al-Din mounted resistance but was defeated by 1230, with remaining Khwarezmian territories conquered under Chormaghun.[54] This campaign marked the effective end of Khwarezmian independence, with an estimated massive loss of life and the destruction of urban centers, though archaeological evidence from sites like Otrar indicates some continuity rather than total annihilation.[55]

      In the western steppes, Mongol forces under Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, targeted the Kipchak (Cuman) Turkic nomadic groups from 1236 onward as part of the broader western campaign.[56] By 1237, Batu had subdued Kipchak territories in southern Ukraine and Kazakhstan, integrating defeated Kipchak warriors into Mongol armies and establishing the Kipchak Khanate, later known as the Golden Horde, which ruled from the 1240s.[56] This conquest facilitated Mongol dominance over Eastern Europe and the Pontic-Caspian steppe, with Kipchak elites eventually Turkicizing the Horde's ruling class through intermarriage and cultural assimilation.[56]

      The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia faced Mongol incursion culminating in the Battle of Köse Dağ on June 26, 1243, where Sultan Kaykhusraw II's army of approximately 80,000 was routed by 30,000 Mongols under Baiju Noyan.[57] Kaykhusraw II fled to Ankara as Mongols seized cities like Kayseri, Sivas, Erzincan, and Ankara, reducing the sultanate to vassal status with annual tribute demands including 12 million silver coins, 500 silk bolts, 4,500 sheep, and 500 camels.[57] This subjugation fragmented Seljuk authority, paving the way for its absorption into the Ilkhanate by 1308 and the eventual rise of successor Turkic states like the Ottomans.[57]

      ## Emergence of Post-Mongol Turkic Polities

      The Mongol invasion culminated in the decisive defeat of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm at the Battle of Köse Dağ on June 26, 1243, imposing Ilkhanate suzerainty and triggering the sultanate's rapid fragmentation into semi-autonomous domains controlled by local Turkic emirs and tribal leaders.[58][59] This power vacuum, exacerbated by internal Seljuk strife following the death of Sultan Kaykhusraw II in 1246 and intermittent Mongol interventions, enabled Oghuz Turkic groups—displaced warriors, pastoral nomads, and ghazi frontier fighters—to establish hereditary principalities known as beyliks, primarily in western and central Anatolia. These entities operated under nominal Mongol oversight via tax-farmers (muqaddams) but increasingly asserted de facto independence by the 1270s, leveraging the Ilkhanate's preoccupation with Persian affairs and internal succession crises.[60]

      Among the earliest and most prominent was the Karaman Beylik, founded circa 1256 by Nure Sofi (or Karaman, a chieftain of the Afshar or Bayat Oghuz tribe) near Larende (modern Karaman) in the Taurus foothills, initially as a nomadic warband resisting Seljuk and Mongol authorities.[61][62] By the 1270s, under leaders like Mehmet Bey, it expanded through raids on weakening Seljuk territories, controlling key routes and fortresses while promoting Turkish as an administrative language in defiance of Persianate Seljuk norms. Other beyliks followed: the Eşrefoğulları in Beyşehir around 1277, deriving from Seljuk vizieral families; the Hamidoğulları in Antalya and Eğirdir by the 1280s; and the Germiyanoğulları in Kütahya, established late 13th century by Yakub Bey from frontier ghazi stock. These polities, numbering over a dozen by 1300, sustained themselves via pastoralism, tribute extraction, and holy war against Byzantine remnants, fostering a mosaic of rival Turkic dynasties that persisted until Ottoman consolidation.[63]

      Further west, maritime-oriented beyliks like Aydınoğulları (emerged c. 1300 under Osman Bey near Birgi) and Saruhanoğulları capitalized on Aegean trade and piracy, blending Turkic nomadic traditions with coastal economies. In Egypt and Syria, the Bahri Mamluk Sultanate—established May 1250 by the Turkic slave-soldier Aybak after deposing the Ayyubids—represented another post-conquest Turkic polity, with its Kipchak Turkish elite repelling Mongol incursions, notably annihilating a 20,000-strong Ilkhanid force under Kitbuqa at Ain Jalut on September 3, 1260, thereby securing the Levant as a Turkic-Muslim bulwark.[64] This victory, leveraging superior cavalry tactics and alliances with local Crusader states, halted Hulagu Khan's westward push and affirmed Mamluk dominance until Circassian ascendancy in the 1380s.

      In Central Asia, the Chagatai Khanate (apportioned 1227 to Genghis Khan's son Chagatai) underwent accelerating Turkicization by the late 13th century, as Mongol elites intermarried with Karluk and Kıpçak Turks, adopting Chagatai Turkish—a Karluk dialect—as the lingua franca for administration and poetry, while retaining Mongol imperial structures like the kurultai assemblies.[65] Rulers like Duwa Khan (r. 1282–1307) enforced Islamic conversion among elites post-1260s, blending Turco-Mongol nomadic governance with sedentary Timurid precursors in Transoxiana, setting the stage for fully Turkic successor entities by the 1340s.[66] These developments underscored the resilience of Turkic tribal networks amid Mongol overlay, transitioning from vassalage to hybrid polities by 1300.

      ## Genetic and Archaeological Evidence on Migrations

      Genetic analyses of Y-chromosome and autosomal DNA from modern Turkic-speaking populations identify a shared "Inner Asian" genetic component originating from the Altai-Sayan region near southern Siberia and Mongolia, supporting an eastern steppe homeland for proto-Turkic groups around the 1st millennium CE.[67] This component, characterized by excess identity-by-descent sharing among western and eastern Turkic groups, dates to medieval expansions and reflects migrations of nomadic carriers of Turkic languages westward into the Volga region and southward toward Anatolia between the 6th and 13th centuries.[67] Haplogroup distributions show heterogeneity, with East Eurasian lineages like C2 (up to 20-30% in some Siberian Turkic groups) and Q indicating steppe nomadic ancestry, admixed with West Eurasian R1a and R1b from interactions with Indo-Iranian and local populations during early khaganate expansions.[68]

      In Anatolia, following Oghuz Turkic migrations after 1071 CE, admixture models estimate a Central Asian Turkic contribution of 9-15% in modern Turkish genomes, with the remainder deriving from pre-existing Bronze Age and Byzantine Anatolian ancestries.[67] [69] Ancient DNA from sites like Çapalıbağ (1300-1650 CE) confirms this pattern, positioning medieval samples intermediate between Byzantine and medieval Central Asian profiles, with no evidence of wholesale population replacement but rather incremental male-biased gene flow consistent with elite dominance.[70] Predominant Y-haplogroups in contemporary Turks—J2a (18%), R1b (15%), and R1a (12%)—align more closely with West Asian and European lineages than East Asian ones, underscoring limited demographic impact from 11th-13th century influxes despite linguistic Turkification.[69]

      Archaeological correlates of these migrations include tamga symbols—linear tribal emblems etched on petroglyphs, stelae, and metalwork—appearing in Altai and Semirechye from the Göktürk era (6th-8th centuries CE), persisting into westward routes and signifying clan identity amid khaganate expansions.[71] Kurgan mound burials with horse sacrifices, composite bows, and iron stirrups mark nomadic encampments in Transoxiana and the Pontic steppe by the 7th-10th centuries, aligning with Bulgar, Pecheneg, and Cuman movements, though such practices overlap with prior Scytho-Sarmatian traditions.[72] Balbal anthropomorphic stones, erected as grave guardians from the 6th century onward, appear in Central Asian necropolises and sporadically in Anatolian Seljuk contexts, indicating cultural transmission.[73] However, in western termini like Anatolia, continuity in urban settlements and ceramics suggests migrations involved small warrior elites rather than large settler waves, with Steppe markers overlaying indigenous substrates. Limited ancient DNA from core Turkic periods (e.g., Göktürk burials) constrains direct linkages, as material culture alone cannot unambiguously denote ethnicity without genetic corroboration.

      ## Linguistic and Cultural Continuity Disputes

      Scholars generally affirm the philological continuity of Turkic languages from the earliest attested forms in Old Turkic runic inscriptions of the 6th to 8th centuries CE, such as those from the Göktürk Khaganate, to medieval vernaculars like Karakhanid and Chagatai, evidenced by shared morphology, phonology, and core lexicon.[74] However, disputes persist regarding the internal classification and divergence timelines of the family, with Bayesian phylolinguistic models estimating a proto-Turkic origin around 2,000–2,500 years ago and subsequent branching into Oghuz, Kipchak, and Karluk groups by the 8th–10th centuries, challenging earlier views of a more uniform "Common Turkic" stage.[75] These debates highlight influences from substrate languages, such as Iranic or Mongolic, which introduced lexical borrowings and structural shifts, particularly in peripheral branches like Oghur (e.g., Bulgar and Chuvash), raising questions about the purity of descent versus areal convergence.[76]

      Cultural continuity among Turkic groups during 500–1300 is marked by enduring nomadic pastoralism, tribal kinship structures, and Tengrist cosmology, which persisted despite Islamization from the 10th century onward in states like the Karakhanids and Seljuks, often syncretizing with Sufi practices and epic oral traditions.[77] Yet, historiographical disputes center on the fluidity of ethnic identity, as articulated by Peter Golden, who argues that medieval steppe confederations were bound more by shared economic adaptations to pastoralism and political alliances than by immutable linguistic or mythic ties, allowing for assimilation of non-Turkic elements like Iranic Alans into Kipchak or Cuman groups.[78] In regions like Anatolia and the Volga, elite Turkic migrations imposed language and governance but coexisted with substrate populations, leading some scholars to question the depth of cultural replacement versus superficial overlay, with evidence from toponyms and folklore suggesting hybridity rather than unbroken transmission.[79]

      These disputes reflect broader tensions in sourcing: Turkic nationalist historiography, prevalent in post-Soviet contexts, emphasizes unbroken descent from ancient khaganates to foster pan-Turkic unity, often downplaying assimilative disruptions, while earlier Soviet-era analyses fragmented identities to counter irredentism, potentially understating linguistic filiation. Empirical resolution favors integrated evidence, where linguistic stability supports core continuity amid cultural adaptations driven by conquest and ecology, as seen in the resilience of motifs like the sky-god and heroic epics across Uighur, Oghuz, and Kipchak variants.[80]
